# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to utlize technical analysis skills to create a Travel Itinerary Map based on the customer's weather preferences. The Weather Database folder uses Open Weather Map API to pull weather from countries worldwide.  In the Vacation Search folder you can find analysis that will gather the information retrieved from the customer's input on weather preferences.  Then using Google Maps API, we are able to plot different travel destinations that are marked with traveling infomation such as Hotel name, City, Country, the weather description and maximum temperature.

Finally, using the Vacation Itinerary analysis we are able to use Google Maps directions API to create a travel itinerary that will map out the full route to travel to all cities of interest.
